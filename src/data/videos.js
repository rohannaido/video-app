        description:
          "A few months ago I had the privilege of being able to enter and see parts of western Syria. We went to see a few of the country‚Äôs major cities and ancient historical sights. Our trip was very emotionally challenging but also beautiful in many ways. Meeting Syrians, hearing their stories and capturing a small part of what the country looks like today was not a simple goal but one I hope you will enjoy joining me on. Sending lots of love to all of the Syrians of the world. Thank you for welcoming me and teaching me about your culture.",
